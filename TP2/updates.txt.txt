TP 2 UPDATES - The Harmonograph

TP1:
- gear-arm drawing system

TP2:
- parametric equations are used to compute the position of the points. The core hard-math part is done :D!
- I structured the file as a multi-modal game
- I started structuring features such as drawing speed/color

To do list:

- manage speed/timerfired
- set GUI (slider buttons)
- polish all features
- improve drawing graphics
- include export .jpg feature


Total time so far: 33h
