My project is a digital drawing machine that simulates the motion of the harmonographs.
A harmonograph is a mechanical device that draws ellipses, spirals, figures eight and Lissajous
curves based on the oscillatory motion of two or three pendulums.

My project is entirely modeled in Python Tkinter, with local use of PIL methods on images.
My ambition was to recreate a complex physical behavior with the use of a basic tool like Tkinter.
To recreate the complex motion of pendulums, I modeled rotating gears connected to rigid arms. 
Each gear rotates with its own:
- center X
- center Y
- angular momentum
- damping factor
- arm lenght
- direction

Depending on these parameters, we obtain different beautiful graphical results.
The study of the documentation and the solution of the math part of this problem was a challenge.

The goal of this application is to offer an insight on how the laws of physical motion and trigonometry
can have an effect on these drawings.
At the same time, it is supposed to be a relaxing zen app. Be harmonic!

I hope you enjoy.

Thank you!
